## Why use it?

CompositeAdapter allows you to build a single list with a RecyclerView that contains distinct and separate data sets.

The composition strategy in place allows you to reuse and combine existing adapters without needing to learn any new and elaborate APIs. Just build vanilla RecyclerView.Adapters and add them to the CompositeAdapter.

## How to use it?

- Build out your RecyclerViewAdapters as needed for different sets of data.
- Add each Adapter to an instance of CompositeAdapter.
- Pass the CompositeAdapter instance to your RecyclerView. 

## Demo & Other Info
